 Bander is a social networking app for musicians, producers, and live venues. This app helps artists find collaborators, and live music venues find great local talent.

-- Currently being redesigned with a better UI, and switching database over to AWS Amplify. --

### Create New Account

### Your Profile Screen 
After Selecting "Done" on the previous Edit Profile Screen users will be taken to their profile so they can see what other users will see when their profile shows up. From here you can edit your profile, sign out which takes the user back to the Login Screen, and navigate to the Searching Profiles Screen.

## Whats Next? 
<ul>
<li>Develop filtering options so users can find others based on genre, instrument, etc.</li>
<li>Embed Soundcloud into the app allowing users to show off their top 3 songs</li>
<li>Allow users to add a 30 second video to show off their skills</li>
<li>Change location usage to allow users to select a location rather than use their location data from their phone</li>
<li>Create a "Like or Pass" system where users can like other users and if they match then allow users to communicate with each other </li>
<li>Develop a Matches screen with a messenger service inside the app allowing users who match with each other to communicate from inside the app. Removing the need for outside contact info. </li>
<li>Update UI</li>
</ul>
